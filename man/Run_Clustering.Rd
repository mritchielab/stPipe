\title{Perform Basic Clustering Algorithms}
\usage{
Run_Clustering(gene.count, matched.data, path, num_clusters = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{gene.count}{A data frame containing gene count data with gene IDs as row names.}

\item{matched.data}{A data frame containing matched spatial coordinates with raw UMI counts.}

\item{num_clusters}{Number of clusters during clustering. Default set to five.}
}
\value{
A list which contains interactive clustering visualization result with related data frames.
}
\description{
This function performs basic clustering using t-SNE and UMAP, either before or after the QC step and outputs visualizations results.

\details{
T-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)

T-SNE is a popular dimensionality reduction technique used to project high-dimensional data into two or three dimensions.
It optimizes for preserving the local structure of the data, meaning that points that are close to each other in high-dimensional space will remain close in the lower-dimensional representation.
This method is widely used in single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics to explore the heterogeneity of the data and identify cells or spatial regions with similar expression profiles.

UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)

UMAP is another popular dimensionality reduction technique that aims to preserve both the local and global structures of the data, with a stronger emphasis on efficiency.
It excels at handling large datasets, generating low-dimensional projections in less time compared to T-SNE.
Unlike T-SNE, UMAP seeks to retain both local and global data structures, making it more suitable for capturing broad clustering patterns across the datasets.
